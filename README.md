# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **TITAN CameraMan** — a tech enthusiast and Linux learner pushing the limits of Android. I explore advanced system setups using only a smartphone and Termux.

### 🚀 What I'm Doing
- Learning Linux through Termux, without needing a PC.
- Running native XFCE4 desktops and Debian PRoot with full GUI support on Android.
- Using hardware acceleration with Zink in Termux.
- Building scripts, tutorials, and environments for desktop-class Linux on phones.
- Running GUI apps from PRoot on native Termux X11 via TCP/XDG/PulseAudio bridging.
- Following productivity.
